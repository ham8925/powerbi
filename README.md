I download the csv file from this link - https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 7 : Since the data contains various ratings, thus in order to represent ratings, a new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into average calculation.
           
           Although, by default, while calculating average, blank values are ignored.
